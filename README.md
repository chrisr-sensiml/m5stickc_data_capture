# m5stickc_data_capture
Implements WiFi streaming for SSI spec for the IMU for the M5StickC

This is an Arudino Sketch for the M5StickC that enables streaming the IMU (Acc,Gyro) data out over Wi-Fi following the SensiML Simple Stremaing interface specification. This can be used in conjuction with the SensiML Data Capture Lab or the SensiML Gateway to view/record the data stream.

You will need the m5Stick SDK in order to run this https://github.com/m5stack/M5StickC.
Instructions for getting setup with the m5Stick SDK on the Arduino IDE are here https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_development

You can connect directly with the open gateway. Use the m5_stick.ssf if you want to capture data via the Data Capture Lab.
